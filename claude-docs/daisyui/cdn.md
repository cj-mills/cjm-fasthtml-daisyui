# Use daisyUI from CDN

How to use daisyUI from a CDN?
You don't need to install anything. Just add one of these to the `head` tag of your HTML :

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daisyui@5" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tailwindcss/browser@4"></script>
```

### Adding all themes

daisyui.css includes light and dark themes. For other themes, add themes.css file as well:

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daisyui@5/themes.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```
